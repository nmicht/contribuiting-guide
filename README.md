# Contributing Guide

This repo is intended to list options for different contributing guides.

### Why to have a contributing file in your repo?

To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to the root of your project's repository.

For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to quickly communicate how people should contribute.

For contributors, these guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.

For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle generated by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.
